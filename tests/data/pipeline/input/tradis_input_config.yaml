# TraDIS Configuration File
# This file contains thresholds and parameters for Dynamic Window and Gene Report Categorization.
# Modify the values as needed. Descriptions are provided for clarity.

Dynamic_Window_3_5_Prime_Ends_Params:
  dynamic_window: true  # (True/False) If True, all other parameters except prime_feature_size are ignored.
  max_window: 2000  # Maximum prime end size that can be created.
  min_window: 200  # Minimum prime end size that can be created.
  initial_win: 400  # Initial prime end size within which the insertion density is checked before dynamic window propagation.
  initial_win_sum_thres: 200  # Threshold for the sum of insertions within the initial window.
  gap_threshold: 200  # Maximum allowed discontinuity in the prime end.
  drop_ratio_threshold: 0.5  # Percentage drop in insertions required to be considered a change point.
  moving_average: 50  # Moving average of indices with a window size of 5.
    # prime_feature_size: 198  # Default length of the prime end if dynamic_window is False (in base pairs).

Gene_Report_Categorization_Params:
  q_val: 0.05  # Q-value (modified p-value) significance threshold.
  inactivation_fraction_threshold: 0.2  # Minimum percentage of transcription required for knockout categorization.
  log_fc_threshold: 2  # Log fold change (LogFC) threshold for protection, knockout, and up/down regulation.
  blue_red_logfc_diff_threshold: 0.4  # LogFC difference threshold between forward and reverse strands, used to identify knockouts despite upregulation.
  overlap_threshold: 0.6  # Minimum overlap between an adjacent gene and the prime end required for knockout/up/down regulation classification.
  insertion_signal_similarity_avg_threshold: 0.5  # Maximum allowed variation in insertion values across condition replicates.
  distance_threshold: 0.9  # Shape-based similarity consistency check across conditions.
  insertion_count_sum_threshold: 75  # Minimum average total insertions across condition replicates required for gene categorization.
  insertion_count_max_threshold: 30  # Minimum average of maximum of non-zero insertions across replicates required for gene categorization.
